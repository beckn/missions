### Implementation Guide

As we saw in the previous section, the primary task in Seeker Application development will be to

- understand the message flow and data required to be sent in each message
- map that data to the Beckn schema for each message.
- similarly map the Beckn schema from response to extract the data we need

To help you with this task, the community and network facilitator will release implmentation guide for various domains, use cases and networks. Choose the right implementation guide for your case before proceeding further.

The implementation guide will contain the following sections:

1. It will explain the overall domain, the various use-case categories
2. Detailed use cases along with message flow diagrams
3. Example data and mapping to the Beckn Schema for the various messages required for each usecase category
4. Layer 2 Configuration file required to be installed for that network (more on this later)
5. Details on sandbox support (for seeker application developers) and postman collection (for provider application developers).

You can find some sample implementation guides below.
