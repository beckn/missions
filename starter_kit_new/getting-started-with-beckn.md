## Introduction

[Beckn](https://github.com/beckn) is an open protocol that facilitates commerce transactions on open interoperable networks. This document guides participants new to the network to get up and running.

### Different Roles in an Open Network

#### [Beckn Application Platforms (BAP)](#beckn-application-platforms-bap-1)
**Description**: Beckn Application Platforms (BAPs) serve as the seeker or consumer side platforms in the network. They provide the interface for consumers to access information, products, or services from various sources.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Acquires customers as users
- Does NOT maintain an active inventory
- Provides a rich “resource-seeking” and buying experience
- Interfaces with Beckn Provider Platforms (BPPs) and Network Facilitators to place orders, track status, etc.

#### [Beckn Provider Platforms (BPP)](#beckn-provider-platforms-bpp-1)
**Description**: Beckn Provider Platforms (BPPs) operate on the supply side of the network. They maintain active inventories and catalogs, implement supply logic, and enable the fulfillment of orders.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Acquires businesses/service providers as users
- Maintains an active inventory/catalog of products or services
- Provides a rich “resource-providing” experience
- Interfaces with Beckn Application Platforms (BAPs) and Network Facilitators to publish catalogs, create orders, etc.

#### [Network Facilitator](#network-facilitator-1)
**Description**: Network Facilitators enable other organizations to join the network through technology, business, or onboarding services.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Provides technical, business, or onboarding services
- Facilitates other participants in joining and operating within the network

#### [Technical Service Provider (TSP)](#technical-service-provider-tsp-1)
**Description**: Technical Service Providers (TSPs) offer specific technical solutions or support to network participants, such as hosting, integration, or development services, etc. 

## [Identify Your Role](#identify-your-role)
Selecting your role within the Beckn network is the first step in your journey. Your role will define how you interact with other participants and what value you bring to the network.

- **Beckn Application Platforms (BAP)**: If you operate on the consumer side, facilitating access to services without maintaining an inventory.
- **Beckn Provider Platforms (BPP)**: If you manage inventories and supply products or services.
- **Network Facilitator**: If you help other organizations join and operate on the network.
- **Technical Service Provider (TSP)**: If you provide technical solutions or support to other network participants.

## [Define Your Requirements and Success Definition Clearly - Outcome Visualization](#define-your-requirements-and-success-definition-clearly---outcome-visualization)
This step is crucial for network participants to define the use cases they wish to enable on the network and to visualize the desired outcomes.

- **Identify the Use Case**: Determine the specific use case you want to enable on the network, such as a particular type of transaction, service, or user interaction.
- **Craft the End-to-End Transaction Flow**: Define the complete flow for an end-to-end transaction, from discovery to post-fulfillment.
- **Pick Relevant APIs**: Select the APIs applicable to your use case, ensuring they align with the intended user experience and functionality.

This process helps in scoping out the necessary functionality, UI, and backend integration requirements to enable an end-to-end transaction on the network.

## [Map Your Journey as per the Role Selected & Outcome Visualization](#map-your-journey-as-per-the-role-selected--outcome-visualization)
After identifying your role and visualizing the outcomes, map out your implementation journey.

- **For Beckn Application Platforms (BAPs)**
- **For Beckn Provider Platforms (BPPs)**
- **For Network Facilitators**
- **For Technical Service Providers (TSPs)**

These steps will guide you through your integration process based on the role you have chosen.
