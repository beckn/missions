# General Beckn message flow and error handling

Beckn is a aynchronous protocol at its core.

- When a network participant(NP1) sends a message to another participant(NP2), the other participant(NP2) immediately returns back an ACK/NACK(Acknowledgement or Negative Acknowledgement in case of error - usually with wrongly formed messages).
- An ACK is an indicator that the receiving participant(NP2) will process this message and dispatch an on_xxxxxx message to original NP (NP1)
- Subsequently after processing the message NP2 sends back the real response in the corresponding on_xxxxxx message, to which again the first participant(NP1).
- This message can contain a message field (for success) or error field (for failure)
- NP1 when it receives the on_xxxxxx message, sends back an ACK/NACK (Here in both the cases NP1 will not send any subsequent message).
- In the Use case diagrams, this ACK/NACK is not illustrated explicitly to keep the diagrams crisp.
- However when writing software we should be prepared to receive these NACK messages as well as error field in the on_xxxxxx messages
- While this discussion is from a Beckn perspective, Adapters can provide synchronous modes. For example, the Protocol Server which is the reference implementation of the Beckn Adapter provides a synchronous mode by default. So if your software calls the support endpoint on the BAP Protocol Server, the Protocol Server waits till it gets the on_support and returns back that as the response.

**Structure of a message with a NACK**

```
{
    "message": {
        "ack": {
            "status": "NACK"
        }
    },
    "error": {
        "code": 400,
        "message": "OpenApiValidator Error at BAP-CLIENT",
    }
}
```

**Structure of a on_select message with an error**

```
{
    "context": {
        "action": "on_select",
        "version": "1.1.0",
        ...
    },
    "error": {
        "code": 30001,
        "message": "Requested provider is not in the database"
    }
}
```
