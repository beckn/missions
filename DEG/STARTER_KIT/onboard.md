# DEG (Digital Energy Grid) Sandbox Onboarding Guide

## Introduction

Welcome to the Digital Energy Grid (DEG) Sandbox Environment!

DEG is an open and decentralized energy exchange network powered by the Beckn Protocol. The DEG network enables seamless peer-to-peer energy transactions between buyers (consumers) and sellers (prosumers) using a standardized and interoperable protocol.

To participate in the DEG sandbox network, every Network Participant (NP) must onboard themselves by installing the necessary Protocol Servers and registering with the DEG Registry.

This guide will help you understand the steps required to onboard as a:

- BAP (Buyer-side Participant)
- BPP (Seller-side Participant)
- Or Both (Hybrid Role)

## What is DEG Registry?

The DEG Registry is the network's authoritative source of participant information and configurations for the DEG domain sandbox environment. Every participant must register themselves on the Registry to join the DEG network for testing and development purposes.

## Onboarding Overview

### 1. Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Beckn Protocol Concepts
- Access to the DEG Sandbox Environment
- Git and Node.js installed locally
- Access to Beckn-Onix Repository

---

### 2. Install Protocol Servers using Beckn-Onix

Beckn-Onix provides ready-to-use protocol server implementations for both BAP and BPP roles required for seamless network participation in the DEG (Digital Energy Grid) domain.

These servers come with built-in support to install and configure all the necessary supporting services like MongoDB, RabbitMQ, and Redis â€” ensuring a smooth developer experience.

You can refer to the **Beckn-Onix Starter Kit** for step-by-step setup instructions:
